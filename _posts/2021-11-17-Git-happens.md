## Room Description -

  Boss wanted me to create a prototype, so here it is! We even used something called "version control" that made deploying this really easy!

**Room Link -**  [https://tryhackme.com/room/githappens](https://tryhackme.com/room/githappens) 

**Creator - **  [hydragyrum](https://tryhackme.com/p/hydragyrum) 


### Task 1 - Find the Super Secret Password

**NMAP**

```bash
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Wed Jul 21 01:43:34 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -v -p 80 -Pn -oN git-happens.nmap 10.10.73.189
Nmap scan report for 10.10.73.189
Host is up.

PORT   STATE    SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp filtered http

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap
Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
# Nmap done at Wed Jul 21 01:43:37 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.18 seconds


``` 

As you can see there is only one port open :

**Port 80 ** - ` HTTP `

**Web Enumeration**

We get a static login page  as below 👇🏻

There is nothing much here , let's do some directory busting .

> ffuf -c -t 100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://git-happens.thm/FUZZ

We get the following directories

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628158936558/ZSR8JmSD5.png)


```bash
.git/HEAD
css
index.html
``` 


The .git directory is what interests me since this box is related to git .

Lets take a look at that directory

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628159120067/OXABUNUtq.png)

Cool ! Let's download all of them using a tool called `gitdumper` which is a part of `GitTools` repo.
Link - https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools

Runnning the help command on `gitdumper.sh` tells us the syntax which we need to use to run the tool .

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628159392614/HaMgY6fPQ.png)

As the tool says lets create a directory to download all the files. I made a directory called **git** and ran the script along with the URL of the website.


```bash
 /opt/tools/GitTools/Dumper/gitdumper.sh http://git-happens.thm/.git/    git


``` 


```bash

``` 

Once its done , let's check it out using git commands.
 

```bash
 git status
``` 



![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628159716089/mjXTQFDuZ.png)

So these were the files which were not committed yet .Lets enumerate further and see whether we get any other information



```bash
git log
``` 


Running `git log` command gives us these results

If you go through the comments of all the commits , one of the comments seem quite interesting .


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628159885300/BOjbUQyBP.png)

Seems like its the source code of the login page we saw earlier !

Lets view what changes were made during that commit -


```python
git show 395e087334d613d5e423cdf8f7be27196a360459
``` 


After scrolling through the source code, we find this piece of code where there is an insecure login function which contains the username & password of admin 😂
