## Summary - 

 Traverxec is a easy rated machine from hackthebox which involves a public exploit for nostromo web server by which we gain a foothold on the box . On the machine there's a user called `david` .We find an id_rsa key of David in one of the directories  & thus escalating our privileges to David. For root, we make use of a sudo misconfiguration on journelctl binary to escalate our privileges to root !

As you can see there are 2 ports open :

**Port 22**  - `SSH`    - `OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u1 `

**Port 80**  - `HTTP`  - `nostromo 1.9.6`

**Website - Port 80**

As the nmap scan showed ,the website isrunning on `nostromo`  web server of `version 1.9.6` , lets look for public exploits for this version using searchsploit .


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626501650018/0r0mODJGa.png)

And we have a `remote code execution` vulnerability for this version of nostromo.
I had some issues with python2 when solving the box so I had to use metasploit  this time.

Open msfconsole and search for nostromo & you will get this exploit .

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626501886372/qXzvevdRR.png)

## Foothold -

Lets use the metasploit module . Set the LHOST,RHOST,RPORT & other parameters needed  for the exploit to work and finally run the exploit .

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626502025094/zSIi3oFaI.png)

And we are in as `www-data` user  !

Viewing `/etc/passwd` tells us there is a user called `David`


```bash
cat /etc/passwd |grep -i "bash"
``` 


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626502184080/OLZ0T6ih4.png)

## Shell as David -

I ran Linpeas to check for any interesting files or any priv-esc vectors , it displayed an md5crypt password  hash of David 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626502540277/pFTAF4_TW.png)

I used hashcat to crack it 


```bash
hashcat -m 500 htpasswd /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --username --force
``` 
 

Now we have this - `david:Nowonly4me` .

**But this password doesn't seem to help as I couldn't ssh into the machine as David.**

Time for some manual enumeration!

Lets look for any files from nostromo web server ,

In `/var` , we see a directory called **nostromo** .Lets enumerate that directory as it might contain some juicy information.

Looking at `/var/nostromo/conf/.htpasswd` - we have that hash which linpeas found for us .

In the `/var/nostromo/conf/nhttpd.conf` we have these contents which seems interesting!

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626502964249/2m1cEL5hT.png)

After reading the documentation of nostromo , I came to know that **homedirs serve as the home directories of the user**.

**So under david's home directory we have a public directory called `public_www`**.Lets lists the contents of this directory

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626503406080/dxHW0QMQk.png)

We find that there is another directory within it called `protected-file-area`.Lets list the contents  of that directory now ,

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626503551130/5LiHP0T7D.png)


We have 2 files `.htaccess` & `backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz` .The tar file seems interesting .Lets copy it to /dev/shm and lets extract the contents of the tar archive.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626503793599/BbXESSW2v.png)

We can see we have id_rsa key from the extracted files,lets copy that to our machine .

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626504653363/CdZ50MkD3.png)
It is encrypted hence we will use `ssh2john` to extract a hash of it and then crack it using rockyou wordlist !


```bash
 ssh2john id_rsa > hash

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
``` 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626504849405/m16iIFs5B.png)

And we have the password .Make sure to give correct permissions to id_rsa & now lets SSH into the machine as **David** 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626505593907/t2P8pyPFg.png)

## Shell as Root -

Running Linpeas ,we find that we have a shell script called `server-status.sh`

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626505711907/SNmVcu7X-.png)


I checked if there are any cronjobs running which executes this script & there wasn't any. I even used **pspy** to check for any cronjobs run by root which were not visible to us. And still we find nothing . 

OK .lets check the contents of the file .
```
#!/bin/bash
cat /home/david/bin/server-stats.head
echo "Load: `/usr/bin/uptime`"
echo " "
echo "Open nhttpd sockets: `/usr/bin/ss -H sport = 80 | /usr/bin/wc -l`"
echo "Files in the docroot: `/usr/bin/find /var/nostromo/htdocs/ | /usr/bin/wc -l`"
echo " "
echo "Last 5 journal log lines:"
/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/journalctl -n5 -unostromo.service | /usr/bin/cat 

```
The last line seems weird . **Journelctl is run with sudo**  .

> Journalctl is a utility for querying and displaying logs from journald, systemd's logging service. Since journald stores log data in a binary format instead of a plaintext format, journalctl is the standard way of reading log messages processed by journald


But the key thing here is the sudo rule breaks when a pipe command is introduced.Meaning that **any command after  pipe will not be executed with sudo permissions ! **'

So in the last line only `/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/journalctl -n5 -unostromo.service` is executed with sudo permissions and not `/usr/bin/cat` .

Lets check   [GTFOBINS](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/journalctl/)  for any **sudo misconfiguration in journelctl** to escalate our privileges.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626507057730/7zgDvi3uN.png)

### *Steps* -

Run the command 

```bash
 /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/journalctl -n5 -unostromo.service
``` 


Type `!/bin/sh` & hit ENTER .

WOHOO ! We are **root** !

Grab the `root.txt` 🚩
